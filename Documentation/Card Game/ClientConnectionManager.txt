=== ClientConnectionManager ===
===============================

Singleton run by the client to connect to the server

SetNewIP() and SetNewPort() can be used by Unity Input Fields to choose an IP and port to connect to
ConnectButton() attempts to connect to the given IP at the given port, and loads the CardGame scene if it connects

ReceiveCommand() attempts to read the NetworkStream connected to the server
	- It first reads the first 4 bytes to determine the size of the incoming packet
	- It then reads the rest of the packet
	- If data was read, it attempts to create a CGCommand and add it to the CGCommandRunner
	
ClientConnectionManager.instance.TransmitStream() sends a bitstream to the server
	- It pads 1 bit onto the end of the bitstream as a buffer
	- Then it sends the length of the bitstream in bytes
	- It then sends the bitstream
	
===============================
=== ServerConnectionManager ===
===============================

Singleton run by the server to connect to two clients

InitializeServer() initialises the server using the given IPAddress and port
ConnectToClient() waits for a connection and saves it as either client 0 or client 1

ServerConnectionManager.instance.TransmitStream() sends a bitstream to the given client (0 or 1)
	- Works similarly to ClientConnectionManager.TransmitStream()
	
ReceiveStream(int player) attempts to read the NetworkStream connected to the given client
	- Works similarly to ClientConnectionManager.ReceiveCommand()
	- Creates and returns a SGCommand
